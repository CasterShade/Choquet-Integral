# Choquet-Integral 
# SynthNonLinearClassifiedDataGen: Non-Linear Data Classification Using Genetic Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a synthetic non-linear classified data generator and classifier using genetic algorithms. The implementation is based on a research paper and includes functionalities for generating synthetic data, classifying it using Choquet hyperplanes, and optimizing the classification process through a genetic algorithm.

The solution supports **N-dimensional data classification** and visualizes results for 2D cases. The attached Python file contains the full implementation.

## Results

### Target Classification

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the provided script:
   ```bash
   python NonLinearClassifiedSyntheticNDimDataGenV2.py
   ```

3. Customize the parameters for dimensions, data size, and genetic algorithm settings within the script:
   ```python
   dg = SynthNonLinearClassifiedDataGen(
       dimensions=2,
       size=200,
       intersection=[0.2, 0.5],
       intersection_flag=False,
       planes=initialize_plane,
       chromosome="001000100000110..."
   )
   ```

4. Visualize results using:
   ```python
   dg.visualize(data)
   dg.visualize_choquet(data, "chromosome_here")
   ```

5. Run the genetic algorithm:
   ```python
   best_chromosome, cur_D, generation_count = dg.learn()
   print(f"Best Chromosome: {best_chromosome}")
   ```

## Known Issues
- **Performance**: The code is currently slower for higher dimensions. Optimization is planned.
- **Visualization**: Only supports 2D visualization for now.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Improve computational efficiency for higher dimensions.
- Extend visualization support for 3D and higher-dimensional data projections.
- Experiment with additional optimization techniques to compare with genetic algorithms.
